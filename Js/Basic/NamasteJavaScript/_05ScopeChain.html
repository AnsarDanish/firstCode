// var can be hoiested means we can access varible which is defined by var keryword it will print undefine
// but if we do same thing varible which is define by let keyword so it will give error like  Cannot access a before initialization

let a; // in case of let and const varible get hoiested but it is not stored in global space. tehy stored in seprate
       // memory space. u can not access this varible before its initialization. therefore we cant access
       //  temporal dead zone:- time between let and const varible memory allocated  and value initialization
      //       if we  access let and const varible in this time zone we get refrence eroor that value can not be access

      // in const we must to initialization it cant be done like that declare in one line and init it anothoer line
