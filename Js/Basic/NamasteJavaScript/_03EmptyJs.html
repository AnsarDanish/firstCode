  if you have an empty file and when you ran it what does java script engine

  Ans :-  Eventhoug when we have an empty file java script writes some code for us and it gives or create the object
          at first step it creates global execution context
          second step it creates object of window in side of it we have lots of function predfine which we can use it
          for example alert()  propmt() 
          and third is this varible is created


          here we will talk about window global object. 
          this=== window    it will give true.  beacuse when global context is created along with this varible and window object
          is created and this refer to window object.this is all done by java script engine.
