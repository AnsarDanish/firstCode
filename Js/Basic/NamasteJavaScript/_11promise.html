     so over here createOrder responsiblity will be that it createsOrder and generate orderid and call ProceedToPayment
    but problem is over here that we have dependent to createOrder api that after some time of interval it will call ProceedToPayment
     that problem is known as Inversion of control. and there is also an issue with callback that is callback hell
     but this both can be handle through the promises
    */

    /*
    
    method 2:
     so createOrder we design in such a way that it will not take callBack function rather it will return promise object
  
    
    in second method we are not passing a callback function rather we are attching here with then method of promise object
    in second method we have control to calling ProceedToPayment.
    as soon as promise object data will be filled callBack (ProceedToPayment) will be automatically get called
    
    Interview ans what is Promsise
    Promise is an Object . that works as a container for future value. it is an imutable object

    promise object has 3 property pending , fullfilled , and rejected
    at initial time promise obejct will be in pending state.
    when state becomes fullfilled it calls cb which we attched with then function of promise . callback function is called only
     one time this assure js from us. then function will automatically gets called. 
    when state becomes rejected 
    
    what is benefit of promise:-
    first of all promise gives to solution for call back hell.
    inversion of controll
    promise gives the trust to us that when it is resolved then it will called then() method and when it is rejected
    it will call catch() method.
    
    
    
    
     call back hell (code statrts to execute horizontally insteadof vertically  )
    
    createOrder(cart , function(orderId)
    {
        ProceedPayment(orderId ,function(paymentId)
        {

        showOrderSummary(paymentId , function(paymentId)
        {

            updateWalletbal(paymentId)
        })
    })
    })

 solving call back using promise chain

    const promise =   createOrder(cart)

    .then(function(orderId){

       return ProceedPayment(orderId)
    })
    .then(function(paymentId) {

       return  showOrderSummary(paymentId )
        });
    
    
    
    
    
     */

    const github_api = "https://api.github.com/users/ansardanish";
    const promise = fetch(github_api);

    const promise2 = createOrder(cart)

        .then(function (orderId) {

            return ProceedPayment(orderId)
        })
        .then(function (paymentId) {

            return showOrderSummary(paymentId)
        })
        .then(function (paymentInfor) {

            return updateWallet(paymentId)
        });
