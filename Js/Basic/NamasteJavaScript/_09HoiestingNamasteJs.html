trying to access varible and function befor its initialization and decleration is called hoieting
why we can access hoiest varible with var keyword and can not access when the same varible is defined with let , const keyword

so actually this happens because js engines define both type of varible in a different memory space. hoiested member can be only 
accessible when those is allocated in global object memory space.
