//  Closures: it is like function along with its scope  if we have fuction inside it we have another function
//   and we are returning it so just does not return only function and return also its lexical scope

//so assume that there is a function which name is outer and inside the outer function 
// there is a another function which name is inner function . when we return inner function
// from outer function it not only return function but also it return lexical scopes , means it parents function scope.
